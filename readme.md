### ***Calculate the Rated Current of an LED***

The Rated current calculator program was developed to calculate the current of an LED, once you input the values for the following; supply voltage, forward voltage and the resistor value the program would output the calculated Rated Current of the LED. The following is some test data you can use to test the program.

| Supply VOltage | Forward Voltage of LED | Rated Current | Program Result           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| 9              | 1.8                    | 20            | 8.91 Rated current       |
| 5              | -4                     | 0.001         | 4000.5 Rated current     |
| 3.3            | -4.5                   | 0             | Infinity Rated current   |
| 5v             | 2v                     | 20.5mA        | 4.9 Rated current        |


Feel free to use your own test data to have a go at calculating the supply voltage.
